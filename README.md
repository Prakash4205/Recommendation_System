# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system built using the [MovieLens 100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). It explores three different approaches to recommend movies based on user preferences:

1. **Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)**
2. **BERT-based Universal Sentence Encoder**
3. **TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS)**

Each approach uses pre-trained models to generate embeddings for movie titles and user preferences, which are then used to recommend movies to users.

## Overview

The movie recommendation system utilizes embeddings generated by Universal Sentence Encoder and BERT to represent movie titles. User representations are created by averaging the embeddings of the movies each user has rated. The TensorFlow Recommenders approach builds and trains a model to predict user preferences based on movie and user embeddings.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
